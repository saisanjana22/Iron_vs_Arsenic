# Iron_vs_Arsenic
Welcome to Iron vs. Arsenic! The gray block is the Iron and represents you. You can move this block around using your arrow keys. The purpose of this game is to get a high score by touching as many green blocks as you can.  Touching red blocks(Arsenic) results in death and touching blue blocks(water) makes the iron rust and move slower.
